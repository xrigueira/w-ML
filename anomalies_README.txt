The two following anomalies have been removed from anomalies.csv:

901;05-03-2013 02:00:00;11-03-2013 00:00:00;turbidity, water_level
901;14-10-2017 18:00:00;15-10-2017 18:00:00;water_level

Both of them refer to anomalies in water_level, which is not used
in this analysis. In the case of the first anomaly, turbidity does 
not present any significant variations.
